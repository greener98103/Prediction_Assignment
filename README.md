# Prediction_Assignment
Attached are the results project where I used personal activity data from accelerometers on the belt,
forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. These participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly
and incorrectly in 5 different ways. I took this data and constructed a machine learning algorithm that 
allowed me to predict accurately the manner in which they exercised. Listed below is a list of the out puts and raw data
necessary to perform this analysis
